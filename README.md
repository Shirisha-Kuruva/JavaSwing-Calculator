## 📌 What I Built

I created a desktop calculator that:
- Looks like a real calculator
- Takes user input using buttons (like a physical calculator)
- Displays results clearly
- Handles basic math operations

## ✅ Features

- ➕ Addition
- ➖ Subtraction
- ✖️ Multiplication
- ➗ Division
- 🟰 Equal to (`=`) for calculating
- 🔁 Clear all (`AC`)
- 🔢 Decimal point support (`.`)
- 💯 Percentage (`%`)
- 🔄 Positive/Negative toggle (`+/-`)
- ✔️ Square root (`√`)
- ❌ Error handling (e.g., divide by zero or invalid square root)

## 🎯 Outcome / What the Project Does

- When you run the program, it opens a **calculator window**
- You can **click on numbers and operators**
- It performs **real-time calculations** just like your mobile/physical calculator
- It handles common edge cases like:
  - Divide by zero → shows `"Err"`
  - Negative square root → shows `"Err"`
- The display updates smoothly after each operation
